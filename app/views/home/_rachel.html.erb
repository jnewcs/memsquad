Hey y’all!
<br/><br/>
For those of you I haven’t met or seen around campus my name is <b>Rachel</b>. I am originally from Northwest Arkansas, which means I’m a big advocate of Sweet Tea and Country Music. At Stanford I can be found working at The Stanford Fund, lounging in Rinconada, watching House of Cards, planning the next Frosh Council event with the rest of my slate, or grabbing a Zip Car to go to church at Menlo Park Presbyterian with some friends. I am planning on majoring in International Relations, which means I’m that girl who follows Hillary Clinton and the Obamas on Twitter, Facebook, AND Instagram. I am an avid believer in big dreams so you may see me running for something else in the future-like United States President (Morrow for a Better Tomorrow 2036). Fun Fact: If the Russian KGB ever kidnaps you I might be able to save you with some broken Russian!
<br/><br/>
Besides days spent on Wilbur field, Mexican Hot Chocolate from Coupa, and long walks on the beach ;) the other thing I am passionate about is the Class of 2018! I would love to get to know all of you better so feel free to friend me on Facebook and message me!
<br/><br/>
Frosh Love,
<br/>
<b>Rachel Morrow</b>
