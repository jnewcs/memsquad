Hey everyone!
<br/><br/>
If I haven’t met you yet, my name is <b>Jack Seaton</b>. I’m that tall guy whose head you may have seen poking out of some crowd. However, my spirit animal is a massive dog that will never give up on the dream of being a lap dog. I come from Connecticut where winters are a bit different than they are here. Little secret about a guy who had some outlandish expectations for the west coast- I only brought one pair of pants when I first came to Stanford with the thought that shorts would be acceptable all year round. Protip: California gets cold, everyone. 
<br/><br/>
I’ve been doing my best all year to bring you guys the news from the world of Cardinal sports. I write the Daily’s articles on Stanford Soccer, Men’s Basketball and Men’s tennis. It’s the best way I could think of to go to essentially every Stanford sporting event and not get judged. I spend way too much time with people and I really want you to be one of them. Call me, beep me, if you want to reach me or do literally anything else to become a part of my life! I asked nicely.
<br/><br/>
Always,
<br/>
<b>Jack Seaton</b>
