<b>I’m Ibrahim Bharmal</b>, and as the great Hermione Granger said, “I’ll go with you.” I’m serious. If you’re reading this, that means you are a part of this wonderful community that we are lucky enough to call home. You are part of my family, and whenever you need me, I’ll go with you. That’s probably a little weird for a stranger to say, so here’s a little bit more about me. I come from a small town called Buena Park in sunny, sunny Southern California. My family is my entire life and I am forever grateful to my little clan of Bharmals. I am the biggest mama’s boy you’ll ever meet and if you make a “yo momma” joke, I’ll probably cry. So don’t. It’ll be awkward for everyone involved.

As of now, I’m planning on double majoring in Comparative Arabic Literature and International Relations, to eventually work in educational reform in the Middle East. At Stanford I had the honor of being your Frosh Council President. Student government is my passion and I hold 8 years of experience under my belt: I hope to continue that in the following years! Positive thinking is what I live by, and wholeheartedly believe in the power of good intentions. Goodness will find each and every one of us. It always has. It will again. (That’s from The Road, by Cormac McCarthy- READ IT).

If you see me riding my deathly hallows longboard (thank you YikYak for that brief moment in the limelight) around campus, be sure to say hi! Although try not to be too abrupt, as I scare easily, and will most likely face plant.

Stay Magical,
<br/>
