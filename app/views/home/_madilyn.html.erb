Hey guys!
<br/><br/>
<b>I’m Madilyn Ontiveros!</b> Born and raised in Southern California, it was a huge adjustment coming to Stanford. I bought my first raincoat in anticipation of a rough winter, and learned to endure temperatures that go below 70 degrees. Thankfully I was welcomed by an amazing class of 2018, which has warmed my heart more than any sweater could! ;)<br/><br/>
When I’m not working on projects for BASES, or attending meeting and lectures with Stanford in Government, you can find me <strike>climbing onto buildings/sneaking into places I probably shouldn’t</strike> procrastinating on my work and listening to the Sam Smith soundtrack on repeat. <br/>
I’m hoping to pursue a major in MS&E, and a life goal of mine is to travel the world and land a career in business and tech!<br/><br/>
So, if you ever want to play a pick-up game of basketball, or grab white elephant vanilla lattes at Coupa, or do any other outdoors-y things, I would love to hang out/ get to know all of you! <br/><br/>
Lots of love, <br/>
